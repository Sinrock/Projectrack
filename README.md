# ProjecTrack

ProjecTrack is an application to create, edit, view and delete various projects you have to do.  It was originally made to keep track of "honey-do" projects at home, but it can be use to track projects anywhere!

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```bash
gem 'ProjecTrack'
```
And then execute the following command:
```bash
$ bundle install
```
Or you can install it yourself by using:
```bash
gem install ProjecTrack
```

## Usage

Start the server using:
```bash
shotgun
```
Then head to your localhost address provided upon server start-up.
You can create a user, create a project, and manage those all from the web interface.  The information is stored in a SQLite database for retrieval.
